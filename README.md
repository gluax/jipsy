# Jipsy

Jipsy is a lisp-interpreter written using Nodejs and EC6 style JS.
  - Use node to run the jipsy-cli and you can type lisp in a cli enviornment

# Supported Features!
  - Mathematical operations such as +, -, /, *, and %
  - Conditional logic such as if statements, equals, not equals, less than, greater than and other standard logic operations
  - A user can also define their own functions to be used

## More information
  - This is a prototype for understanding the work that goes into writing a lisp interpreter as I plan to write a better version in another language.
  - To use simply clone the repo, and have node installed. Then just type "node jipsy-cli.js" and you will be brought to a cli.
  - You can press control-c twice to exit the cli.
